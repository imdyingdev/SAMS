I'll create a comprehensive Python script for handling RFID logs with attendance tracking, error handling, and various attendance states. This will include realistic business logic for time tracking.I've created a comprehensive RFID attendance logging system with all the features you requested. Here's what the script includes:

## Key Features:

**1. Attendance Status Labels:**
- `present` - On time login
- `late` - Login within 15 minutes of start time
- `so-late` - Login between 15-60 minutes late
- `absent` - More than 60 minutes late or no show
- `excuse` - Excused absence
- `timeout` - Logout action

**2. Error Handling & Limitations:**
- **Double login prevention**: If user is already logged in, prevents immediate re-scan
- **Timeout enforcement**: 30-minute minimum between login/logout scans
- **Grace period**: 5-minute buffer for frequent scanning attempts
- **Input validation**: Checks for valid user IDs and data
- **Custom exceptions**: `RFIDLogError` for specific RFID-related errors

**3. Smart Business Logic:**
- **Schedule-based status**: Automatically determines if user is late based on 8:00 AM start time
- **Session tracking**: Maintains user login state and scan history
- **Excuse system**: Allows marking users as excused for specific dates
- **Daily reporting**: Generates comprehensive attendance reports

**4. Advanced Features:**
- **Logging system**: Comprehensive logging of all activities
- **Time validation**: Ensures scans are appropriately spaced
- **Status persistence**: Maintains user status throughout the day
- **Session management**: Tracks login/logout pairs properly

## Usage Examples:
The script includes a demo that shows various scenarios like normal login, error cases, very late arrivals, and excused absences. You can customize the schedule times, thresholds, and business rules by modifying the `AttendanceSchedule` class.

The system is designed to be production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and data validation. Would you like me to modify any specific aspect of the logic or add additional features?
